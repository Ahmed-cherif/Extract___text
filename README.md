Algorithm 1: Extracting Month and Year from Text
This algorithm is designed to extract the month and year information from a given text. 
It utilizes regular expressions to identify common month names and four-digit year patterns within the text. 
Here's how the algorithm works:

Define regular expression patterns for month and year extraction.
Search for month and year patterns in the provided text.
If a month pattern is found, extract and store the matched month.
If a year pattern is found, extract and store the matched year.
Return the extracted month and year.


Algorithm 2: Extracting Name of Formation or University from Sentence
This algorithm aims to extract the name of a formation (such as a university, college, school, etc.) from a given sentence. 
It uses regular expressions to identify keywords associated with educational institutions and captures the subsequent 
words that likely represent the name. Here's the algorithm's procedure:

Define a regular expression pattern for extracting the name of a formation/university.
Search for the pattern in the provided sentence.
If a match is found, extract and store the name of the formation/university.



Please note that both algorithms are based on regular expressions and are tailored to capture common patterns. 
While they cover many typical cases, there might be variations that they don't handle perfectly.
These algorithms provide a foundation for extracting specific information from text, and they can be further refined and extended to accommodate more diverse scenarios.
